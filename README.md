# SA.FE Loot Contract Calculator

A Google Apps Script standalone script for displaying a loot buy contract
calculator, that correctly calculates the 85% of Jita buy loot payout along
with handling NPC buy orders for blue loot correctly.

## Getting Started

This script is managed with [gapps][gapps].  Follow the setup instructions
up to step 2, and then you can use the checked-in `gapps.config.json` to
deploy if you have access to the Google Apps Script project.

If you want to attach this to another Google Apps Script project, fork the
repository, delete the `gapps.config.json` file, and generate a new one
with `gapps init <your-file-id>`.
